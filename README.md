## hcphb

A package for analyzing the FWS-NMFS Habitat Conservation Plan handbook draft revision.

## The Handbook

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) wrote the first handbook for [Habitat Conservation Plans](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/hcp-overview.html) in 1996. In June, 2016, they released a draft revision of the handbook. We undertook this analysis to help us understand what text had changed and what concepts had changed. The analyses (in Vignettes) first take a sentence-by-sentence analysis to match text between the current and revised documents by measuring sentence similarity. Next, we use topic modeling of chunks of sentences to identify topics that are covered by each handbook - which topics are the same, which topics have been dropped, and which topics are new.

## Functions and example

We may be able to generalize the functions in this analysis package to facilitate arbitrary document comparisons. If you would like to help with this, please [contact us](mailto:esa@defenders.org). However, even if such generalization takes some time (likely), we hope this analysis package can be a model for others wishing to do this type of comparative analysis.
